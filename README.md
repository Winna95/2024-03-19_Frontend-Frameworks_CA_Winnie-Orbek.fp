## Noroff Online Shop

### Description
This project aims to build an eCommerce store using React and the Noroff Online Shop API. It includes a homepage with a searchable product list, individual product pages with details and an "Add to Cart" button, a cart page displaying selected items and total cost, a checkout success page confirming orders, and a contact page with a validated form. The app uses a Layout component for consistent header and footer design, and React Router for navigation. The design is responsive, with clean, well-formatted code, and uses styled-components or CSS Modules for styling.

The API used for this project can be found here: [Noroff API documentation](https://v2.api.noroff.dev/online-shop).
